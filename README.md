## 👋 Hello! I'm César

>Sharing knowledge and promoting a community of developers with similar interests is the objective of this repository. Most of the projects hosted here are open source. I think the real treasure is to learn and enjoy the trip, collaborating and inspiring while we build something useful for those who come later.
