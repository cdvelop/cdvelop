## 👋 Hello! I'm César

>My purpose is to share knowledge and foster a community of developers with similar interests. I keep most of my projects as open source because I believe the real treasure is in learning and enjoying the journey, collaborating and inspiring while we build something useful for those who come after.

### 💡 Beyond the code

- I've developed private platforms in the **medical sector**.
- Lecturer at **Instituto AIEP (Chile)**, sharing experience and best practices in programming.

### 📌 Featured projects

- **[tinystring](https://github.com/cdvelop/tinystring):** Ultra-lightweight Go library (up to **75% smaller** than the standard library compiled with tinygo) for text manipulation, conversion, formatting and error handling.
